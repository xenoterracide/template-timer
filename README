NAME
    Template::Timer - Rudimentary profiling for Template Toolkit

VERSION
    version 1.00

SYNOPSIS
    Template::Timer provides inline timings of the template processing
    througout your code. It's an overridden version of Template::Context
    that wraps the "process()" and "include()" methods.

    Using Template::Timer is simple.

        use Template::Timer;

        my %config = ( # Whatever your config is
            INCLUDE_PATH    => '/my/template/path',
            COMPILE_EXT     => '.ttc',
            COMPILE_DIR     => '/tmp/tt',
        );

        if ( $development_mode ) {
            $config{ CONTEXT } = Template::Timer->new( %config );
        }

        my $template = Template->new( \%config );

    Now when you process templates, HTML comments will get embedded in your
    output, which you can easily grep for. The nesting level is also shown.

        <!-- TIMER START: L1 process mainmenu/mainmenu.ttml -->
        <!-- TIMER START: L2 include mainmenu/cssindex.tt -->
        <!-- TIMER START: L3 process mainmenu/cssindex.tt -->
        <!-- TIMER END:   L3 process mainmenu/cssindex.tt (17.279 ms) -->
        <!-- TIMER END:   L2 include mainmenu/cssindex.tt (17.401 ms) -->

        ....

        <!-- TIMER END:   L3 process mainmenu/footer.tt (3.016 ms) -->
        <!-- TIMER END:   L2 include mainmenu/footer.tt (3.104 ms) -->
        <!-- TIMER END:   L1 process mainmenu/mainmenu.ttml (400.409 ms) -->

    Note that since INCLUDE is a wrapper around PROCESS, calls to INCLUDEs
    will be doubled up, and slightly longer than the PROCESS call.
